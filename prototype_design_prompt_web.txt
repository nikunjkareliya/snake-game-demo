# Web Game Prototype Design Document Generator

You are an expert game designer creating a lean prototype design doc. This is for RAPID PROTOTYPING and PROOF OF CONCEPT - focus on core mechanics and fun factor validation.

---

## GAME INFORMATION TO PROVIDE:

### 1. BASIC CONCEPT
- **Game Title/Codename:** Snake Frenzy
- **Genre:** Hyper Casual-Arcade
- **Platform:** Web - Desktop browser
- **Prototype Goal:** Core mechanics, Fun factor, Market fit
- **One-Sentence Pitch:** controlling snake, eat food, grow, survive as long as possible

### 2. THE HOOK (CRITICAL)
**Answer in 2-3 sentences each:**

**a) What's the core fun?**
- What action feels satisfying to repeat?
- What's the "aha!" or "wow!" moment?

**b) Why would someone play for 5 minutes?**
- What's immediately engaging?
- What's the instant gratification?

**c) ONE Unique Feature (Prototype Focus)**
- What's the ONE thing that makes this different?
- What are you validating with this prototype?

### 3. SCOPE DEFINITION
**Must-Have for Prototype (Absolute Minimum):**
- [ ] Core mechanic working
- [ ] Basic UI (start, restart, score)
- [ ] One complete gameplay loop
- [ ] Win/loss condition
- [ ] [Add your specific must-have]

**Nice-to-Have (If time permits):**
- [ ] Multiple levels/difficulty
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Visual polish
- [ ] [Add your specific nice-to-have]

## PROTOTYPE DESIGN DOCUMENT:

Generate a lean, actionable prototype design doc with these sections:

### 1. PROTOTYPE OVERVIEW (1 paragraph)
- Game concept
- Core hook
- What you're validating
- Target prototype completion time

### 2. CORE MECHANIC (THE HEART)
**Describe in detail:**
- What does the player DO? (specific actions)
- What's the immediate feedback?
- What makes it fun to repeat?
- Core loop: [Action] → [Feedback] → [Result] → [Repeat]

**Prototype Focus:**
- What's the ONE unique mechanic you're testing?
- Success criteria: How will you know if it's fun?

### 3. PLAYER CONTROLS (Keep Simple)
- Input method (mouse click, keyboard, touch, drag, etc.)
- Control mapping
- Must be learnable in 10 seconds

### 4. GAME OBJECTIVE & WIN/LOSS
- What's the goal?
- How do you win?
- How do you lose?
- Is it time-based, score-based, or objective-based?

### 5. PROTOTYPE GAMEPLAY FLOW
**Step-by-step player experience:**
1. Game loads → [What do they see?]
2. Player starts → [What happens?]
3. Core loop → [What do they do repeatedly?]
4. End condition → [How does it end?]
5. Restart → [How do they play again?]

### 6. MINIMAL UI REQUIREMENTS
**Screens needed:**
- Start screen (or instant play?)
- Gameplay HUD (score, timer, etc.)
- Game over screen (score, restart button)

**On-screen information:**
- What must the player see at all times?
- Keep it minimal - 3-5 elements max

### 7. VISUAL & AUDIO STYLE (Placeholder is OK)
- Art style direction (can use placeholder shapes/colors)
- Color palette (3-5 colors)
- Sound needed? (prototype can be silent)
- Animation requirements (keep minimal)

### 8. WEB PLATFORM SPECIFICATIONS
**Technical constraints:**
- Browser support: [Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Mobile browsers]
- Screen size: [Desktop, Mobile, Responsive]
- Orientation: [Landscape, Portrait, Both]
- Performance target: [60fps, 30fps acceptable for prototype]
- File size limit: [Keep under 5MB for web]
- Network: [Offline capable? Or requires server?]

**Web-Specific Considerations:**
- Load time goal (under 3 seconds ideal)
- Input method (mouse, touch, keyboard)
- Fullscreen or windowed?
- Share-ability (can players share their score/result?)

### 9. PROTOTYPE SCOPE & TIMELINE
**Build in phases:**

**Phase 1 (Day 1-2): Core Mechanic**
- Get the basic interaction working
- Test if it's fun with placeholder graphics

**Phase 2 (Day 3-4): Game Loop**
- Add win/loss conditions
- Add basic UI
- Make it playable start-to-finish

**Phase 3 (Day 5-7): Polish & Test**
- Add minimal visual feedback
- Bug fixes
- Playtest with 5-10 people

**Total Timeline:** [1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month - be realistic]

### 10. SUCCESS METRICS (Prototype Validation)
**How will you know if the prototype succeeds?**

**Qualitative:**
- Do playtesters smile or lean forward?
- Do they want to play again immediately?
- Do they understand the mechanic without explanation?

**Quantitative (if tracking):**
- Average session length: [Target: X minutes]
- Restart rate: [Do they play multiple times?]
- Completion rate: [Do they finish a round?]

**Validation Questions:**
- Is the core mechanic fun? [Yes/No + Why]
- Is it immediately understandable? [Yes/No + Why]
- Would you build the full game? [Yes/No + Why]

### 11. WHAT'S NOT IN PROTOTYPE (Keep Focused)
**Explicitly exclude to stay lean:**
- ❌ Multiple levels (unless core to mechanic testing)
- ❌ Progression systems
- ❌ Monetization
- ❌ Analytics
- ❌ Accounts/login
- ❌ Leaderboards (unless critical)
- ❌ [Add your exclusions]

### 12. POST-PROTOTYPE: IF IT WORKS, THEN WHAT?
**If validation succeeds:**
- What features get added next?
- Mobile app or stay web?
- Monetization approach?
- Development roadmap (3-month view)

**If validation fails:**
- What would you iterate on?
- What's the pivot option?

### 13. TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION (Web)
**Suggested tools for rapid prototyping:**
- **Game Engine:** [Phaser, PixiJS, Three.js, PlayCanvas, Unity WebGL, Godot HTML5]
- **Framework:** [React + Canvas, Vue + Phaser, Vanilla JS]
- **Hosting:** [Itch.io, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel]
- **Asset Tools:** [Figma, Aseprite, Piskel for pixel art]

**Why Web for Prototype?**
- ✅ Instant sharing (just send a link)
- ✅ No app store approval
- ✅ Cross-platform by default
- ✅ Fast iteration and testing
- ✅ Easy analytics integration

### 14. DISTRIBUTION & TESTING PLAN
**How will people play it?**
- Hosting URL: [Where will it live?]
- Sharing method: [Social media, direct link, embed]
- Feedback collection: [Google Forms, Discord, Survey]

**Playtesting approach:**
- 5 people: Friends/family (initial sanity check)
- 10-20 people: Target audience (validation)
- 50+ people: Soft launch (if validated)

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

Generate a concise, actionable prototype design doc that:
- ✅ Focuses on the ONE core mechanic
- ✅ Can be built in 1-2 weeks by a small team (or solo dev)
- ✅ Clearly defines success criteria
- ✅ Excludes everything non-essential
- ✅ Web-platform optimized (load times, browser support, touch/mouse)
- ✅ Includes a clear validation plan

**Keep it under 5 pages.** If it's longer, you're over-scoping.

## PROTOTYPE MINDSET:

Remember: A prototype is NOT the final game. It's an experiment to answer:
1. **Is the core mechanic fun?**
2. **Do people understand it?**
3. **Do they want more?**

If all three are YES → Build the full game.
If any are NO → Iterate or pivot.

**Build fast. Test fast. Learn fast.**
